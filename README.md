A fork of touhou origins blessings
Designed to be used in the [Sanctuary ModPack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sanctuary-remake) and gives compatibility between touhou origins blessings and yigd

Full credit goes to the [original Creator](https://github.com/Maxmani/touhou-origins-blessings) I quite literally just added two lines and asked a few people for help

If you'd like to add your own blessings you can do so at


```
data\rewovenblessings\origin_layers\blessing.json
```

You can take my other project as an example if you would like [Valor's Origins, blessings and classes](https://modrinth.com/datapack/valors-origins-blessings-and-classes)
Feel free to use and reuse anything within either projects

Requires:

- [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric)
- [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric)

Optional:

- [yigd](https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd)
